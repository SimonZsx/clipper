Hey, be my guest. Sell whatever you want.
@DGo_64 The scenarios are recreations of classic FE scenes, but you play Warriors stages/missions to defeat enemies on the map.
You've got a big heart, and you've been so understanding with me. Not to mention, you're easy on the eyes. Just oozing with masculinity!
Can I borrow a kiss? I promise I'll give it back.
